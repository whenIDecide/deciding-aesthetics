    <h1>Deciding Aesthetics</h1>
     <h2>Development Solutions</h2>

    <p>Deciding Aesthetics is a project created by Matthew Farr as a home for
    his professional work as a developer with a focus on design. The ethos of Deciding
   Aesthetics is two fold:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>First that if you pursue code that looks good, you end up with more
    funtional code as a by-product. (Besides, who doesn't like some good
     clean code?)</li>
     <li>Second that whenever possible the function of code should be planned with
      the desired aesthetic of the eventual product in mind. A singular vison
       for aesthetic and function makes the work in both categories more
     efficient and successful.</li>
   </ul>
